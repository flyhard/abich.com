# CV Visibility Implementation - Testing Guide

## Implementation Summary

✅ **All tasks completed successfully!**

### What was implemented:

1. **Configuration (.env file)**
   - Created `.env` file with `CV_VISIBILITY` variable
   - Default mode: `shareable`
   - Three modes supported: `hidden`, `shareable`, `public`

2. **Astro Configuration (astro.config.mjs)**
   - Added Vite define to make environment variable available
   - Reads from `process.env.CV_VISIBILITY` with fallback to `'shareable'`

3. **CV Page (src/pages/cv.astro)**
   - Reads `CV_VISIBILITY` from `import.meta.env`
   - Redirects to 404 when mode is `hidden`
   - Sets appropriate robots meta tag based on mode
   - Passes robots meta tag to Layout component

4. **Layout Component (src/layouts/Layout.astro)**
   - Updated to accept optional `robots` prop
   - Conditionally renders robots meta tag

5. **Navigation (src/layouts/SidebarLayout.astro)**
   - Reads `CV_VISIBILITY` from `import.meta.env`
   - Conditionally shows CV link only when mode is `public`

6. **Documentation (README.md)**
   - Added comprehensive CV Visibility Configuration section
   - Documented all three modes with examples
   - Included instructions for changing modes

## Verification from Build Output

### Current Build (shareable mode):

**CV Page (/dist/cv/index.html):**
✅ Contains: `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`
✅ Title: "Per Abich - CV"
✅ Content is fully rendered and accessible

**Homepage (/dist/index.html):**
✅ Navigation does NOT include CV link
✅ Only shows: "Shipman 28" and "Welcome"
✅ CV content is displayed on homepage (index.astro uses SidebarLayout)

## Testing Instructions

### Test Mode 1: Shareable (Current Default)

```bash
# In .env file:
CV_VISIBILITY=shareable

# Build
npm run build

# Expected behavior:
# - /cv is accessible via direct URL
# - Contains <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
# - NO CV link in navigation
# - Won't be indexed by search engines
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check robots meta tag
grep -o '<meta name="robots" content="[^"]*"' dist/cv/index.html
# Should output: <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">

# Check navigation has no CV link
grep -o '<ul class="nav-links".*</ul>' dist/index.html | grep -c 'href="/"' 
# Should output: 0 (no CV link)
```

### Test Mode 2: Public

```bash
# In .env file:
CV_VISIBILITY=public

# Build
npm run build

# Expected behavior:
# - /cv is accessible via direct URL
# - Contains <meta name="robots" content="index, follow"> OR no robots tag
# - CV link APPEARS in navigation
# - Will be indexed by search engines
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check robots meta tag (should be "index, follow" or absent)
grep -o '<meta name="robots" content="[^"]*"' dist/cv/index.html

# Check navigation includes CV link
grep -o '<ul class="nav-links".*</ul>' dist/index.html | grep 'href="/"'
# Should find the CV link
```

### Test Mode 3: Hidden

```bash
# In .env file:
CV_VISIBILITY=hidden

# Build
npm run build

# Expected behavior:
# - Accessing /cv redirects to /404
# - NO CV link in navigation
# - CV is completely inaccessible
```

**Verification:**
The CV page should either not be generated or redirect to 404. Check if the redirect logic works by accessing the page.

## Manual Testing with Dev Server

For quick testing, start the dev server:

```bash
# Edit .env to set desired mode
# Then start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit:
# - http://localhost:4321/ (homepage with navigation)
# - http://localhost:4321/cv (CV page)
```

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] In shareable mode, CV is accessible but no nav link
- [ ] In shareable mode, inspect CV page for noindex meta tag
- [ ] In public mode, CV link appears in navigation
- [ ] In public mode, CV page has index/follow or no robots tag
- [ ] In hidden mode, CV redirects to 404

## Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal state (not job seeking)
```bash
CV_VISIBILITY=shareable
```
You can share https://abich.com/cv with recruiters, but it won't appear on your site.

### Scenario 2: Active job search
```bash
CV_VISIBILITY=public
```
CV is fully visible and linked from navigation.

### Scenario 3: Complete privacy
```bash
CV_VISIBILITY=hidden
```
CV is completely inaccessible.

## Environment Variable Override

You can also set the mode at build time without editing .env:

```bash
# Temporary override for one build
CV_VISIBILITY=public npm run build

# Or in CI/CD
export CV_VISIBILITY=public
npm run build
```
